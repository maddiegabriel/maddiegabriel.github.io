              <h3 class="text-uppercase"><br>How did you get into programming?</h3>
              <h3 class="answer text-muted"><br>My first taste of programming was in a high school Intro to Object Oriented course. I loved the challenge of learning my first programming language (Java). I thought it was so cool to be able to program a cash register for my school store to use.<br><br>I began to dabble in web design on my own time and experimented with other programming languages like Python and Javascript.<br><br>After my 1st year of University in the Arts & Science program, I still found my Computer Science courses the most interesting, challenging and engaging -  so I switched into the Software Engineering program!</h3>

              <h3 class="text-uppercase"><br>What do you love most about programming?</h2>
              <h3 class="answer text-muted"><br>Programming appeals to my love of mathematics and working with an IDE tapped into my artistic side and allowed me to exercised my graphic design skills; but I think the thing I love most about programming is how it is a continual learning process. I love how no matter how much you learn, there is always a new challenge to look forward to. I have also always been a motivated independent learner, and my programming course allowed me to really expand my knowledge and sink my teeth into the content outside of class.<br></h3>

              <h3 class="text-uppercase"><br>Why did you choose to study Software Engineering?</h2>
              <h3 class="answer text-muted"><br>I chose Software Engineering over Computer Science because, while I still get to take all of the core computer science courses, I also have the opportunity to take Software Design courses. These classes are great because they allow me to work on small and large teams with my peers to complete group software projects. I think this is great experience for my future - completing a real software project from start to finish is so fun and is always my favuorite part of the semester. I really feel like I learn a lot from these courses, which cover the Software Development process from start to finish. I have learned about gathering requirements and dealing with clients and changing requirements, about good and bad software design, and even about different types of testing (Black/White Box testing, Unit Testing, etc.). The Software Engineering program allwos me to incorporate my creativity and teamwork skills with my love for programming, and completing a double minor in Math and French means I also am developing all the necessary mathematical and discrete structures concepts that are so important to computer courses.<br></h3>

              <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><br>What did you learn from your first tech internship?</h2>
              <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><br>Last summer (2017) I completed an internship with the Information Technology department at the Halton District School Board central office in Burlington. As an intern I was working on a big project - the re-creation of the School Board's internal staff portal in Sharepoint. I went into the job with virtually to Sharepoint knowledge but with lots sof research, hard work and experimenting I became a vital member of the team and learned the ins and outs of Sharepoint. I was also able to exercise my organizational, interpersonal and communication skills by keeping the team on track for the project. I also learned about user friendly design and dealing with clients - for example, I met with the head of each of our 50 sub departments to come up with a design for their sub-site, which I then built. I fel very lucky to have had the opportunity to work in a real tech office and learn the ropes! It was great to work with smart people and learn from them.<br></h3>

I also design and deliver workshops for the library about effective skills for studying, writing essays and taking exams and often takeover the library's social media accounts to promote our services.<br>I had the great opportunity to be a TA for Software Design I course this past fall, and I loved it! I also am on many intramural teams (indoor/outdoor/bubble soccer, dodgeball and basketball). I am also a member of the Society of Computing an Information Science (SoCIS) and the College of Physical and Engineering Sciences Student Council (CPESSC). I have participated in many recruitment events for the University.</h3>

Are you looking for a job right now?
>> Yes! I am so excited that I am able to be in the Co-Op program. I feel that completing co-op semesters will be an awesome way to explore different cool areas in tech and really find a field that interests me! My first co-op semester is this summer (2018) so I am currently looking for a job in the Toronto or Guelph/Waterloo area!

What do you do outside of your courses?
>>Outside of my courses, I have participated in coding activities like Communitech's Code to Win Challenge, Digital Oceans Hacktoberfest, the Canadian Undergraduate Software Engineering Conference (CUSEC), and experiementing on my own time! I am also a computer science tutor - I teach kids how to program in Python. I love passing on my skills and love for programming to younger kids and hope to inspire them to look into this awesome field! I am looking forwards to attending my first Hackathon this month (Delta Hacks) and attending the Canadian Celebration of Women in Computing (Can-CWiC) in 2018.<br><br><br></h3>
