                      There are hundreds of different technical teams at the Bank, each supporting different areas of the massive platform the Bank uses daily to perform both internal and external operations. I worked on the <i>Findur</i> team during my work term!</i><br><br>
                      I chose to work at the Bank because I knew I would get the opportunity to contribute to systems that are critical to our country's economy, especially during this global crisis. I also was looking forward to moving to Ottawa for the summer, but alas!</p>

                    <h3><b>Overview</b><br></h5>
                        For my final co-op I was a Systems Developer on the Bank of Canada's <i>Gold Squad</i> agile team. This team works on Findur, a large product suite used to support the Bank's public sector fiscal duties. Findur's systems and interfaces facilitate the issuing of foreign debt and the investment of the proceeds, which involves managing bond, money market, loan, foreign exchange and swap transactions. Findur is used internally by Bank employees many times a day. Most of the work I did this term centered around building new features and maintaining existing ones in Findur; below, I've outlined the main projects I worked on. Other than the projects listed, I helped out with various Findur bug fixes, demoed my work to technical and non-technical management, and participated in virtual "Lunch & Learns" about data science and other topics. I also spent plenty of time observing and learning from the senior developers on my team as they handled live support production issues during our team's on-call weeks, which were scheduled about once a month.                         <h3><b><br>Main projects I worked on this term:</b></h5><br>
                        <b>1)  Securities Repo Operations (SRO)</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Canadian economy, I entered the Bank at a crazy time. Every team was very busy building new systems at breakneck speed to support the economy through this difficult time. The Securities Repo Operations (SRO) program was introduced at the Bank to support financial market liquidity. Essentially, as the fallout of the pandemic continues, SRO's provide a temporary source of Government of Canada nominal bonds/treasury bills to primary dealers to support liquidity in the securities financing market. The primary dealers in this scenario are the major Canadian banks - BMO, Desjardins, TD Bank, etc! You can read more about the public release of the SRO program <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/markets/market-operations-liquidity-provision/market-operations-programs-and-facilities/securities-repo-operations/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                            <li>SRO is the main project I worked on throughout this term. I was responsible for building a new interface to allow the Bank of Canada's financial traders to input data about each daily round of SRO auctions. My code essentially parses the given data into appropriate export files which are absorbed into Findur to kick off the SRO process.</li>
                            <li>First, I worked with business analysts and did plenty of research to understand how SRO's work. Next, I met with the traders who would be using the system and gathered information about their requirements.</li>
                            <li>I learned VBA on the job to build an Excel front end system for the traders to use. I created a visual interface and wrote VBA code to gather and parse the data, perform critical error handling, and export a set of files to Findur. One important thing I considered was making this daily process as automated as possible. It was also essential to implement foolproof error handling to avoid human error causing a million dollar disaster.</li>
                            <li>Building on our existing codebase, next we wrote some new Java code to import the above data into the Findur system. This event kicks off the SRO process, which has many complex steps. I also wrote additional Java code to perform pre-procedural error checks in Findur.</li>
                            <li>I was able to demo my work to traders many times while it was in development. This was great practice in presenting my work, accepting feedback and iterating on a project to meet ever-changing needs.</li>
                            <li>I really enjoyed working on this SRO project from start to finish. My system started being used in production in July to facilitate multi-million dollar SRO auctions every day!</li>                        </ul>
                        <b>2) Ticket Printer TPM Changes </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before I started working on the SRO project, I was involved in making changes to the Bank's Ticket Printer functionality on Findur. Due to COVID-19, most Bank employees moved to remote work; this means they no longer have access to the office ticket printers for transactions, so we needed to build a software solution. </li>
                            <li>To support this new functionality I wrote MySQL scripts to make structural database changes. I learned a lot about large production databases and how to safely move data around using Sequel Pro.</li>
                            <li>I also worked on adding additional detailed logging functionality to the Ticket Printer Java code, so it's now easy to see which part of the Ticket Printer is running and where/why any error occured.</li>
                            <li>This was a great project to introduce me to the codebase and learn how to use Findur and update Java plugins within the system.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>3)  EFA Pricing Design</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The final project I worked on this summer was related to a new feature required to support EFA (Exchange Fund Account) Pricing for the Bank.</li><li>Since this project came up in the final few weeks of my co-op term, I was only involved in the design and prototyping of the proposed system. We essentially wrote Java code to imitate the redesigned system we would be implementing.</li><li>This project was fun to work on since I got to do a lot of pair-programming and research with another dev on my team, who I learned a lot from!</li>
                        </ul>

                Having never worked in the area of Systems Development, I was looking forward to learning many new technical skills this term by working alongside the developers on my team. I hoped to become a more experienced Java developer and gain a better understanding of SQL and how relational databases work; I definitely achieved this goal throughout my daily work. I also learned to write VBA scripts to aid in data manipulation & analysis. Lastly, I learned SVN, which is a source control tool I had never used before. I learned so much from observing the senior developers on my team and pair-programming on different projects. Although my term was short, I gained a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time and I wish I could have stayed longer!

                Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my team was working from home remotely (like most of the world!). A particular challenge at the start was beginning my new job virtually, without being inside the physical work location or meeting my new team in person. One of my goals was to improve my remote communication skills so I could better integrate with my team and make connections outside of my immediate co-workers. I hoped to learn ways to overcome the obstacles of remote working. By the end of my term, I felt like a valuable member of <i>The Gold Squad</i> and was comfortable asking questions, giving my opinions and collaborating remotely on projects. The skills I've learned will be useful for the future,since it’s looking like life will still be online in April when I graduate!

                The application my team worked on is used in production by Bank of Canada employees every day to conduct financial business. One of my goals throughout this term was to gain a better grasp of the business side of our application and how it fits into the broader landscape of the Bank of Canada's many services. I knew pretty much nothing about finance going into this term - I've never even taken a business course! I was very curious throughout my term to understand the way the software I worked on impacts daily business. I know I met this goal since I understand lots of financial jargon and can now easily explain financial concepts to my family and friends! I achieved this by seeking extra knowledge, asking questions outside my dev team, and doing lots of research on my own.

                I really enjoyed my final co-op work term at the Bank of Canada! I felt like I was able to contribute to important software that helps our economy stay afloat every day. It was such an interesting experience to step outside of my comfort zone and learn lots of financial theory. The work I did feels important and I learned lots of technical skills through my role as a Systems Software Developer. <i>The Gold Squad</i> was an incredible team to work with, they were very welcoming to me even though I never met them face-to-face! I got the chance to work with and observe some very experienced senior developers. Thank you to the Bank of Canada for an amazing work term!</div>
