This Canadian company was founded in Montreal in 1865, making it over 154 years old!<br><br>Sun Life has buildings in 12 countries all over the world, but for my co-op I worked from the global Sun Life HQ at 1 York Street in Toronto. My floor - known as <i>Ignite Studio</i> - was built just over a year ago. Ignite Studio is home to the teams working on Sun Life's biggest tech innovations. This includes the <i>mySunLife</i> mobile app and Sun Life's <i>Ella</i> for Google Home and Amazon Alexa (my team!).<br><br>I chose Sun Life because I was interested in learning to develop on the voice platform and love the explorative approach the company takes towards new technology.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><b>Overview</b><br>
                        My main responsibility during my work term was to develop new features for Sun Life's voice app, which is available for public use on both <a href="https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000002194e5470e?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Home</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sun-Life-Financial/dp/B07F7F52J5" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa</a>. The app has 2 main functions: users can search for nearby healthcare providers covered by Sun Life, or log in securely to check their Sun Life account balances. This includes clients' health benefits, vision coverage and more.<br><br>
                        <b>Main Tasks</b><br>
                        <b>1)  Work with my agile dev team to build Sun Life's Google Home app</b>

                            <li>Develop several new searching algorithms for Provider Search</li>
                            <li>Quick turnaround - I contributed code to 4 major app releases during my term!</li>
                            <li>Tech-debt tasks (code refactoring, library updates, scalability, etc.)</li>

                            <li>Run code walkthrough sessions to train new co-ops + full time employees</li>
                        </ul>

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">I hoped to exercise my creativity by working on some Innovation projects at Sun Life. Luckily my dev role allowed me the freedom to explore and prototype new ideas. I managed my time to fit this work into my schedule between contributing to delivery-stream dev work. I worked on 6 different prototypes over my work term, at all stages from brainstorming to designing a prototype to pitching!</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 text-uppercase">Communication</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">A goal was to become more comfortable communicating my ideas to an audience. Even as a developer, I got lots of practice through volunteering to do product demos. I learned to present our apps/prototypes to technical and non-technical stakeholders. I also worked on being more vocal in meetings and explaining my ideas clearly. I also got lots of French practice as the only French-speaking team member!</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 text-uppercase">Teamwork</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">As part of the Wildcards dev team, I hoped to improve my teamwork skills and  transfer my agile team experience to future jobs. I observed team practices to see how to best contribute as a new member. I went to agile training and participated fully in all team ceremonies. I got along super well with everyone and was always open to collaborate on design/dev work. We worked together smoothly + had a lot of fun!</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 text-uppercase">Tech Literacy 2.0</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">One goal for my second term was to keep developing my technical skills. Since I was already comfortable with the basics of our codebase, I actively sought out new challenges to work on different features. I lead a project to develop a new feature for our app, which means I was very hands-on with the complexities of the code. Our feature release went very smoothly; we had minimal bugs to fix and it is now live for clients to use! I also did more pair programming with senior developers and got more feedback from code reviews.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 text-uppercase">Leadership</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">As the only 8-month co-op at Sun Life, I got to practice my leadership skills by helping onboard our 3 new students. I helped them get familiar with the team, tools and codebase. I lead code walkthroughs to explain functionality and was always available to answer questions. I loved working with the new students! They started contributing code within their first 2 weeks and were very comfortable asking me questions. We often pair programmed so I could explain tricky areas and to help reduce bugs! I grew into a more confident leader through this experience.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 text-uppercase">Problem Solving</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">A goal was to improve my problem solving skills by taking on difficult challenges. This term I enjoyed tackling more complex code requiring extra research. I volunteered for diverse stories using tools I'm unfamiliar with. For example, I wrote 3 new search algorithms as part of a feature enhancement. I observed devs from many expertises to get well-rounded experience with various technologies and problem solving methods. I expanded my horizons and became a better problem solver when facing unknowns!</p>

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">In response to some feedback from my first term, I renewed my goal to become a more confident presenter and speaker! Throughout this term I volunteered to present at least 10 demos of our product to groups of up to 20 stakeholders/clients, in both English and French. I got better at answering questions on the spot. I also volunteered to speak more in our sprint review presentations and have grown more comfortable each time. At the Sun Life DS Hackathon I presented to a large audience along with my team, and we won 3rd place!</p>

                After completing my first co-op work term, I can say without a doubt that the co-op program is extremely valuable - especially for B.Comp students. My co-op allowed me to take the foundational knowledge I learn in school and apply it to a real-world job with clients and deadlines. It's a nice confidence boost to affirm that I can succeed at a job in my field, which motivates me to continue growing. My experience at Sun Life exceeded my expectations; I had no idea that working at an insurance company would be so cool and fun! Returning to school this semester, I have gained valuable knowledge and perspective on how I wish to focus the rest of my degree!</p>
