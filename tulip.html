                      Tulip is a mid-sized software startup providing a SaaS-based mobile platform for retailers. The goal of Tulip's product is to empower retail stores to better connect their customer and store associate experiences. Tulip's app is widely used on ipads by store associates, mainly at luxury retailers, to assist customers with their in-store shopping experience.<br><br>
                      Tulip has two offices - one in downtown Toronto and one in Kitchener. I worked from the Toronto office for my co-op term. There are many different software teams at Tulip, each working on different portions of the Tulip platform. I worked with the <i>Checkout Nova</i> product team during my work term!</i><br><br>
                      I chose to work at Tulip because I knew I would learn tons of new technical skills by working at a company centred around tech. I also wanted to try working at a smaller company than I have in the past!</p>

                    <h3><b>Overview</b><br></h5>
                        For my co-op I was a dev on Tulip's <i>Checkout Nova</i> product team, made up of four devs, two QA Analysts, a Project Manager and a Scrum Master. My team worked on the <i>Checkout</i> app in the Tulip platform, which allows customers to pay for their purchases in-store on a store associate's ipad. This involves actions like building a cart, calculating regional taxes, processing payments, storing order details, and handling returns/refunds. I worked on a few main <i>Checkout</i> projects during my term, which I've explained below. Other than these projects, I did bug-fixes for our app, demoed new features at Sprint Reviews, pair-programmed with other developers, and worked with different teams when they needed an extra hand. I also spent time doing a lot of self-learning, since my work involved many tools and technologies I had never used before!</i><br><br>
                        <h3><b><br>Main projects I worked on this term:</b></h5><br>
                        <b>1)  Admin Console Return Window Feature</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Admin Console is our web app which allows store managers to configure their store's Tulip platform. One thing managers can customize through Admin Console is their store's ability to process returns & refunds.</li>
                            <li>For this project, I was responsible for building a new feature in Admin Console which allows store managers to configure and edit their return & refund preferences.</li>
                            <li>First, I worked with our UX designers using Figma to understand and improve the feature design.</li>
                            <li>I learned React on the job top build the frontend of this feature from scratch. This involved adding new re-usable components to the Tulip React library and architecting my solution to be extensible.</li>
                            <li>Building on our existing internal API, I wrote the backend code for this feature in PHP. This involved sending, receiving, validating and updating data between our database and the Admin Console frontend.</li>
                            <li>In Sprint Reviews, I was able to demo this feature many times while it was in development. This was great practice in accepting feedback and iterating on my design.</li> 
                            <li>I really enjoyed working on this project from start to finish, and I'm happy it will be used in production when the next app version launches!</li>                     
                        </ul>
                        <b>2)  Tulip's internal <i>Taxman</i> API</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One area of the <i>Checkout</i> app which ended up being more complicated than I anticipated was the calculation of taxes on an order. Taxes are tricky because they're regional and are subject to change based on government legislation.</li>
                            <li>During my co-op, I assisted in developing an internal Tulip API called <i>Taxman</i>. This API acts as an interface between our app and an external tax service to calculate accurate tax amounts for orders based on store location.</li>
                            <li>The work I did on Taxman was mostly in PHP. I also made some structural database changes using MySQL. I learned a lot about database migrations and how to break down a complicated problem.</li>
                            <li>This project was fun to work on since I got to do a lot of pair-programming with another dev on my team!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>3)  Improve the local development environment at Tulip</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During my co-op, I noticed a lack of strong internal documentation for developers, especially around the setup of our local environments. This made it difficult to get onboarded at the start, since there are so many different tools and technologies involed and a lot can go wrong.</li>
                            <li>To fix this problem, I created some new onboarding documentation and FAQ pages to help ease the process for current and future developers at Tulip.</li>
                            <li>During this process, I worked with incoming developers and sales engineers to help them set up their local development environments. This helped me recognize pain points in the setup and improve the documentation in difficult areas.</li>
                        </ul>

                My main goal at Tulip was to learn a bunch of new technical skills. I hoped to gain experience doing both front & backend development. I achieved this and learned many technologies along the way, namely: PHP, React, Docker, MySQL, and JavaScript. Some tools I got more comfortable with include Postman, Xcode for mobile dev, Charles for local dev, and more. I worked hard to learn new skills and overcame plenty of technical challenges, especially during my onboarding learning curve. I tried to tackle my dev work with curiosity, learning independently and asking my team for help when needed. By the end of my term, I was comfortanble with the Tulip dev environment and able to fix most issues that popped up (and help other devs too). I used feedback from code reviews to help improve my skills. As an example of my technical learning, I learned React from scratch to successfully complete a production feature. I also did a Hack Day project using React to solidify my learning.

                My work term in the Tutoring Centre at Sheridan showed me once again how valuable the co-op program at Guelph is. Through my teaching role, I was able to practice valuable soft skills while also deepening my knowledge of many computer science concepts by explaining them to others. I had a great time trying my hand at teaching; I felt like I helped my students every day, and went home feeling content! I made valuable connections with my co-workers, professors and my students, who were from all parts of the world and in all different stages of life. As I return to Guelph this Fall semester, I feel I have gained valuable knowledge, skills and experience which I will apply to my future learning!</p>
