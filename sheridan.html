This Canadian college was founded in Brampton in 1967 and is famous for its arts and technology programs such as animation and illustration.<br><br>Sheridan has three campuses across Ontario - in Brampton, Mississauga and Oakville. I worked from the Trafalgar campus in Oakville for my co-op term. My office - known as the Tutoring Centre - is located in the Library Learning Commons. The Tutoring Centre is an incredible free resource for Sheridan students. It is home to student tutors (like me) whose job is to support students as they study various subjects, from Math to English to Programming.<br><br>I chose to work at Sheridan because I was interested in trying my hand at a teaching-related co-op and wanted to see how I would enjoy it!</p>

                        My main responsibility during this work term was to work one-on-one with my students daily and assist them in their learning. This includeds explaining concepts, helping with assignments/debugging, and going beyond the course content. Altough my title is a Java Learning Assistant, I helped my students with many other programming courses. I was also responsible for running three 'Java Jam' tutorials every week. Lastly, I completed many side-projects to help improve the Tutoring Centre's services.<br><br>

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">I chose Sheridan to challenge myself with a new type of co-op and improve my teaching skills. My main goal was to assess/improve my ability to convey information to novice programmers. I tried to be self-aware when assisting students, recognizing the effectiveness of my own teaching strategies. I paid close attention to students’ responses to see if they were understanding. I prepared for my appointments, allowing me to provide a better tutoring experience. I think I was an effective teacher as my students frequently returned for more appointments; my overall return rate was  75%. While I improved at teaching, I also saw my students become better programmers over the semester!

              <h3 class="mb-3 text-uppercase">Tech Literacy</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">My goal was to expand my technical skills by learning more about the technology my students are working with. Explaining programming concepts requires an in-depth understanding of the content. I feel I mastered the Advanced OOP fundamentals and gained a deeper understanding of Java details by reading the prof-recommended <i>Head First Java</i> book. By the end of my work-term, I could answer/work through all of my students' questions about their course content. I also learned to build custom statistics software using SharePoint/FireApps. I built features to help ease the Tutoring Centre's data collection process  and connect it to Excel reports for management.

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">In my role as a Java LA, I spent most of my time working one-on-one with students or running Java Jams for larger groups of up to 20 students. Through these activities, I achieved my goal of improving my oral communication skills. I paid attention to how I communicated with students, including my tone and body language, and adjusted these behaviours according to their response and specific needs. By the end of my work-term, I felt completely comfortable teaching my students both individually and in groups. I made connections with many individual students who returned to the centre frequently for help, which proves that I was successful in communicating concepts to them.

              <h3 class="mb-3 text-uppercase">Leadership</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">I hoped to improve my leadership skills this work-term by leading three  weekly Java Jam tutorials and by taking initiative to improve the Tutoring Centre services. I think I became an approachable leader figure to my Java Jam students, who often came to me for valuable and knowledgeable guidance/assistance. I feel my students showed me respect and were confident in the assistance and advice I provided them. I also brainstormed & implemented many new ideas to better help students in the Tutoring Centre, which I listed above in the 'My Role' section of this report. I also took initiative to market our services across campus using posters and class visits!

                My work term in the Tutoring Centre at Sheridan showed me once again how valuable the co-op program at Guelph is. Through my teaching role, I was able to practice valuable soft skills while also deepening my knowledge of many computer science concepts by explaining them to others. I had a great time trying my hand at teaching; I felt like I helped my students every day, and went home feeling content! I made valuable connections with my co-workers, professors and my students, who were from all parts of the world and in all different stages of life. As I return to Guelph this Fall semester, I feel I have gained valuable knowledge, skills and experience which I will apply to my future learning!</p>
